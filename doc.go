/*
Package ft232h provides a high-level interface to the FTDI FT232H USB to
SPI/I²C/UART/GPIO protocol converter.

Dependencies

FTDI uses a custom (vendor-defined) protocol to communicate with their USB
devices, and they release proprietary driver software `D2XX` (binary-only)
that application programmers (see: YOU) should use with FTDI USB devices.
These drivers are thus only available for systems officially supported by
FTDI. These drivers are fairly low-level, with barebones C source code header
and user guide (glorified header) as the only documentation resources available.
