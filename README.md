# ft232h
##### Go module for the [FT232H](https://www.ftdichip.com/Products/ICs/FT232H.htm) USB to SPI/I²C/UART Protocol Converter with GPIO

_This is a work-in-progress and not at all stable_

## Features
- [x] **TBD** (WIP)

## Installation
Installation is conventional, just use the Go built-in package manager:
```sh
go get -v github.com/ardnew/ft232h
```
No other libraries or configuration is required. 

###### Common issues
If you have trouble finding/opening your device in Linux, you probably have the incompatible module `ftdi_sio` loaded. See the Linux `Installation` section in [`READMORE`](READMORE.md) for details.

## Supported platforms
Internally, `ft232h` depends on some proprietary software from FTDI that is only available for a handful of platforms (binary-only). This would therefore be the only platforms supported by the `ft232h` Go module:
#### Linux 
- [x] x86 (32-bit) [`386`]
- [x] x86_64 (64-bit) [`amd64`]
- [x] ARMv7 (32-bit) [`arm`] - includes Raspberry Pi models 3 and 4
- [x] ARMv8 (64-bit) [`arm64`] - includes Raspberry Pi model 4
#### macOS
- [x] x86_64 (64-bit) [`amd64`]
#### Windows
- [ ] x86 (32-bit) [`386`]
- [ ] x86_64 (64-bit) [`amd64`]
###### Windows compatibility
Windows support is possible – and in fact appears to be FTDI's preferred target – but drivers for this `ft232h` Go module have not been compiled or tested. The modifications made to `libMPSSE` to support static linkage would need to be verified or merged in for Windows. See the `Drivers` section in [`READMORE`](READMORE.md) for info.
